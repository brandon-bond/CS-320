How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional and secure through testing. Testing is a very important part of creating anything including code.
The importance of testing code is to make sure the end user of the program is getting what they want, or in a corprate setting getting
what they ordered. Another reason to make sure your code is functional is to save money for you or your company and also to keep a
general integeraty to your work.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are found through questioning, if it is needs for a customer, or a questionair if it is a wider userbase of what you are 
making. After figuring out the user needs you will need to translate them into the code or program so you can create what is wanted or
needed for the user. I would break the needs of the user into sections of what can be done then the priority of the needs, then you 
can work on a timeline to get the project done. 

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software through a step by step perspective, for me the easiest way to design something is build a list and go 
through the list in order. I think this is the most efficiant way to complete anything and it can also benifit your testing process
aswell. If you follow a list and you know how the program is supposed to function then you can test after each step and then test again
at the end of the project.
